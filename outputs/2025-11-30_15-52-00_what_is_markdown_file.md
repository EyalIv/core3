## 🧘 The Masters Speak

### Monk Dōgen asks:
> When your fingers strike the keys, shaping the symbols on the luminous screen, does this 'markdown file' emerge as a fixed thing, or is it the very breath of your presence, manifesting and dissolving like a cloud across the sky?

### Ludwig Wittgenstein asks:
> When you call something a 'markdown file,' what is the *job* that word performs in our language? What do we *do* with that label that we might not do if we simply called it 'a text file'?

*In silence, understanding deepens.*
