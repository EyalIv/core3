# Core3 - Kaggle Agents Capstone Submission

**Track:** Freestyle

## Problem Statement

Modern AI assistants are verbose by design. They're optimized for engagement—endless follow-up questions, multi-turn dialogues, and walls of text when a clear, concise answer would suffice. This creates three problems for users genuinely seeking understanding:

**Information Overload.** Ask ChatGPT "How does blockchain work?" and you'll receive 800+ words covering everything from Satoshi Nakamoto to smart contracts. Somewhere in that flood are the 3 concepts that actually matter—but finding them requires work.

**Lost Fundamentals.** Surface-level explanations prioritize breadth over depth. Users walk away knowing *about* a topic without grasping its *foundations*. First principles—the fundamental truths from which everything else derives—get buried under examples and caveats.

**Conversation Fatigue.** The "Is there anything else I can help you with?" paradigm assumes more conversation equals better service. But understanding isn't linear. Sometimes the best thing an AI can do is stop talking.

This matters because learning isn't just information transfer—it's integration. Cognitive science tells us that reflection requires mental space. Constant stimulation prevents the consolidation that turns information into understanding.

## Why Agents?

A single LLM prompt cannot solve this problem. Here's why agents are essential:

**Specialization enables quality.** Extracting first principles requires different reasoning than finding authoritative sources. Formatting Markdown differs from crafting philosophical questions. By decomposing the task across specialized agents, each can excel at its specific function. The Strategist focuses purely on conceptual distillation; the Librarian focuses purely on research.

**Orchestration enables structure.** The experience requires a specific sequence: analyze → research → format → present → pause → reflect. A `SequentialAgent` guarantees this flow. State passes between agents via `output_key`, ensuring each builds on the previous work rather than starting fresh.

**Parallelization enables efficiency.** The two philosopher agents (Dōgen and Wittgenstein) operate independently—neither needs the other's output. Running them via `asyncio.gather()` cuts response time in half while maintaining the parallel nature of their perspectives: one Eastern, one Western.

**Controlled termination enables closure.** Unlike conversational agents designed to continue indefinitely, this architecture has a defined end state. The Sage agent is explicitly instructed to close with "These are the answers"—a deliberate full stop that signals completion rather than invitation.

Agents transform a simple Q&A into a *structured learning experience* with intentional pacing and philosophical depth.

## What You Created

**Core3** (also called Buddhist Oracle) is a 7-agent system organized in two execution phases:

### Phase 1: Sequential Pipeline

Five agents execute in strict order using ADK's `SequentialAgent`:

| Agent | Role | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| **TheStrategist** | Extracts exactly 3 first principles from the topic | `raw_concepts` |
| **TheLibrarian** | Researches authoritative sources using Google Search | `verified_links` |
| **TheEditor** | Formats output as clean Markdown | `triad_text` |
| **TheProjectionist** | Finds a relevant YouTube video via Google Search | `video_link` |
| **TheSage** | Presents the final answer with definitive closure | Terminal output |

State flows through `output_key` attributes. The Strategist stores its analysis in `raw_concepts`; the Librarian reads this and stores its research in `verified_links`; the Editor combines both into `triad_text`. This chain ensures coherent, cumulative refinement.

### The Silence

After the Sage speaks, the system pauses for 5 seconds. This isn't a bug—it's the core philosophy. The pause creates mental space between receiving information and being prompted to reflect. In a world of instant responses, intentional silence is radical.

### Phase 2: Parallel Philosophers

Two philosopher agents execute simultaneously via `asyncio.gather()`:

- **Monk Dōgen** (1200-1253): A Zen master who asks *experiential* questions. "Where in your body do you feel this understanding?" His prompts reject abstraction and demand embodied knowing.

- **Ludwig Wittgenstein** (1889-1951): An analytical philosopher who asks about *language games*. "In what context does this word gain meaning?" His prompts challenge the user to examine how concepts are constructed.

These agents don't expect answers. They plant seeds for continued reflection after the session ends.

## Demo

**Input:** "How does blockchain work?"

**Output:**

```
1. **Decentralization** — No single authority controls the network.
   → https://ethereum.org/decentralization

2. **Cryptographic Hashing** — Data integrity through one-way functions.
   → https://www.investopedia.com/crypto-hash

3. **Consensus Mechanisms** — Network agrees on valid transactions.
   → https://consensys.net/consensus-explained

**Visual Guide:** https://youtube.com/watch?v=blockchain-explained

*These are the answers.*
In silence, understanding deepens.

                    * Silence *

──────────────── The Masters Speak ────────────────

Monk Dōgen asks:
"When you speak of 'trust' in a trustless system,
 where does your body feel that trust reside?"

Ludwig Wittgenstein asks:
"In what language game does 'decentralized'
 gain its meaning—and who taught you to play?"
```

The output is complete, self-contained, and deliberately finite. No "Would you like to know more?" No invitation to continue. Understanding requires space—the system provides it.

## The Build

### Framework & Model
- **Google ADK** (Agent Development Kit) for agent orchestration
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** powering all 7 agents with shared configuration
- **Python 3.10+** with native `asyncio` for parallel execution

### Course Concepts Implemented (4 of 3 required)

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Multi-Agent Sequential** | `SequentialAgent` with 5 sub-agents, state passing via `output_key` |
| **Multi-Agent Parallel** | `asyncio.gather()` executes Dōgen + Wittgenstein simultaneously |
| **Tools** | `google_search` (built-in ADK tool) on Librarian and Projectionist |
| **Sessions & State** | `InMemoryRunner` with `session_service.create_session()` for state management |

### Resilience Engineering

```python
retry_config = types.HttpRetryOptions(
    attempts=5,
    exp_base=2,
    initial_delay=2,
    http_status_codes=[429, 500, 503, 504]
)
```

Exponential backoff with jitter handles rate limits gracefully—essential when 7 agents make sequential API calls.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Shared model configuration** — All agents use identical Gemini settings (temperature 0.7, max 512 tokens) ensuring consistent voice.

2. **Explicit closure instruction** — The Sage agent's prompt includes: *"End with exactly: 'These are the answers.'"* This prevents the LLM's natural tendency to invite follow-up.

3. **Philosopher personas** — Detailed system prompts give Dōgen and Wittgenstein distinct voices rooted in their actual philosophical traditions. Dōgen rejects abstraction; Wittgenstein examines language games.

4. **Silence as feature** — `time.sleep(5)` after the Sage output. Unconventional in UX, essential to the philosophy.

## If I Had More Time

**Memory Bank Integration.** Track topics users have explored across sessions. "Last week you studied blockchain. Today's query about cryptography connects to Principle #2 from that session."

**Observability Layer.** OpenTelemetry tracing to visualize agent execution flow, token usage per agent, and latency bottlenecks. Essential for optimization.

**Cloud Deployment.** Deploy to Cloud Run or Agent Engine for persistent availability. Currently runs locally only.

**Loop Agent for Quality.** Add a refinement cycle where an evaluator agent scores the 3 principles for fundamentality, sending weak ones back to the Strategist.

**Voice Interface.** The Zen aesthetic aligns naturally with spoken word. A calm voice delivering 3 principles, followed by actual silence, then philosophical questions—this could be powerful as an audio experience.
